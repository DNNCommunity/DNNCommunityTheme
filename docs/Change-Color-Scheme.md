## Change Color Scheme
Most websites are going to key off the colors for the brand being represented.  Following industry best practices, there are typically three colors selected for the website main colors: primary, secondary and tertiary. These are defined within the `./src/scss/variables/_colors.scss` file. Updating these SCSS variable color definitions using HEX or RGB colors will change usage of these throughout the theme.  

There are also colors defined for variants of gray, normal font colors, borders and links. These are all easily modified within this one file.

Additionally, base Bootstrap classes can be used for various colors within your custom theme.
