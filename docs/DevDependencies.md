### Node
From the website: "Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world."

### Yarn
Where npm set the groundwork for a package system, it falls short in many aspects. Yarn, the successor to Bower, helps manage packages with ease. Quick, secure, and reliable, Yarn is the front-runner for package management.

### Gulp
Gulp is what we use to automate the painful stuff. error checking, compressing, minifying, zipping, anything you hate doing over and over, there's probably a way to automate it using Gulp and it's plethora of plugins.

### gulp-autoprefixer
Forget about making sure you add the -webkit- prefix. This plugin automatically adds all the prefixes necessary for all the major browsers and versions.

### gulp-clean
Allows for easy deletion of files. We use it to get rid of temporary files created when building packages.

### gulp-clean-css
Allows for simple minification of CSS.

### gulp-imagemin
Nicely compresses images as small as possible while maintaining quality. We don't use this in our main tasks, but is still available because we believe it is a necessary tool for a lot of theme creation.

### gulp-jshint
Checks javascript for errors and lets you know what's wrong.

### gulp-notify
Helps show messages in the node command line console.

### gulp-rename
Used to rename files.

### gulp-replace
Replaces string values within files. Not currently used, but will possibly be used in future releases of nvQuickTheme.

### gulp-sass
This powerful plugin error checks, concatenates, and minifies scss. We use it for all the things.

### gulp-uglify
A plugin that helps minify all the things. Since our sass plugin already does that for us, we use this to minify our javascript.

### gulp-zip
Just like it sounds, this zips files. This is used in our theme packaging task to help create the resource files for DNN.
