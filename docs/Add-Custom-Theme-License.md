## Add Custom Theme License
As of Version 2.0.0 of **nvQuickTheme**, a new file is located in the root (`./`) folder of the project and is named `themeLicense.txt`.  You can place a license within this file and the contents will automatically be displayed during the appropriate installation step within DNN using the project's output theme package.
