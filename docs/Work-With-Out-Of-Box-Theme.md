## DNN Install Package
With each new release of **nvQuickTheme**, we create a **DNN Install Package** for the out-of-box theme that **nvQuickTheme** produces.  This is a highly optimized theme that can be used by anyone.  These install packages can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/nvisionative/nvQuickTheme/releases).  The install package (ZIP file) will follow the following naming convention:

```
nvQuickTheme_<version>_Install.zip
```

Once you have the ZIP file downloaded, you may install it into the desired DNN instance in the same manner you install other themes, via the **Extensions** page.

### Important Note:
Since the purpose of **nvQuickTheme** is more for development of custom themes, you wouldn't want to attempt to tweak the **Install Package** in order to create your custom theme.  Instead, you will want to:
* [Get your local development environment up and running](https://github.com/nvisionative/nvQuickTheme/wiki/Installation)
* [Setup your custom project](https://github.com/nvisionative/nvQuickTheme/wiki/Project-Setup)
* [Utilize the commands that are built-in the nvQuickTheme framework](https://github.com/nvisionative/nvQuickTheme/wiki/Commands)
